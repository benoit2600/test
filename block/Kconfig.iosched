	default y
	---help---
	  The CFQ I/O scheduler tries to distribute bandwidth equally
	  among all processes in the system. It should provide a fair
	  and low latency working environment, suitable for both desktop
	  and server systems.

	  This is the default I/O scheduler.

	  Note: If BLK_CGROUP=m, then CFQ can be built only as module.

	---help---
	  Enable group IO scheduling in CFQ.
	  
config IOSCHED_DEADLINE
	tristate "Deadline I/O scheduler"
	default y
	---help---
	  The deadline I/O scheduler is simple and compact. It will provide
	  CSCAN service with FIFO expiration of requests, switching to
	  a new point in the service tree and doing a batch of IO from there
	  in case of expiry.
	  
config IOSCHED_ROW
	tristate "ROW I/O scheduler"
	---help---
	  The ROW I/O scheduler gives priority to READ requests over the
	  WRITE requests when dispatching, without starving WRITE requests.
	  Requests are kept in priority queues. Dispatching is done in a RR
	  manner when the dispatch quantum for each queue is calculated
	  according to queue priority.
	  Most suitable for mobile devices.

	  block devices.
